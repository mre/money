![Money](/money.png)

Sample code for my talk [*Idiomatic Rust*](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/rust_idiomatic/), which I gave at FOSDEM 2018.  

This library shows how to create ergonomic value objects in Rust.  
The point of this case-study is to show common Rust idiomas and patterns.
*A word of caution:* this code is for educational purposes only.  
Generally, it's a bad idea to represent a monetary value as float.  
If you want to implement something similar for real-world use-cases, read  
[this](https://deque.blog/2017/08/17/a-study-of-4-money-class-designs-featuring-martin-fowler-kent-beck-and-ward-cunningham-implementations/) first.

Only works on nightly Rust for now [until slice patterns are stabilized](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/23121).
